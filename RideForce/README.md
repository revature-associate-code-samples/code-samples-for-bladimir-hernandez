Project 3: Ride Force - PWA Conversion

RideForce is a ride coordinating application developed for Revature Associates. Revature associates can create an account with a temporary access token generated by the app upon request of the trainer. A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. Associates who require a ride can coordinate with associates who have registered cars based on proximity and preference.

The project in its entirety can be found at: https://github.com/revaturelabs/rideshare-client

For this project sprint, I was placed with the frontend PWA conversion team. Google's auditing tool Lighthouse was used to measure the metrics of the application at the time when the team initially received the project. A Service Worker was implemented into the project and the ability for the application to be installable was added.
