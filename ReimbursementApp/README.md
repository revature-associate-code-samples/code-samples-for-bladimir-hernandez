Project 1: Expense Reimbursement Application: Payback, A Reimbursement System 

This application is a full stack application. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Core Java and Java Servlets for the middle-tier, and JDBC is used to connect to the database. Payback is design to manage reimbursement requests for employees. An employee can create a reimbusement request and submit it. A manager is then able to approve or deny the request submitted by the employee. A manager can also view all the requests made for all the employees.
