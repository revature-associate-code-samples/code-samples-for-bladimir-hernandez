Project 2: Name-And-Game

This application is a full stack Java Web Application. It is built using the Angular framework for the frontend and the spring framework for the backend of the application along with the utilization of the IGDB API. This API is used to retrieve the appropriate game information a user is requesting. This application is design to aid gamers to search for video games by the name of the videogame, the platform they use, the developer of the videogame, and the genre of the videogame.
